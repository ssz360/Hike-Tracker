# ***How to run***

Run <code>***docker compose up -d***</code> in the terminal

To use the app, choose the directory you want to use as root, then write a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following line of code and save it inside.

    version: "3.8"
    services:
        client:
            build: ./client
            image: sof2team15/hike-tracker:client
            ports:
            - 3000:3000
            volumes:
            - "./client:/app"
            - /app/node_modules/
        
        server:
            build: ./server
            image: sof2team15/hike-tracker:server
            ports:
            - 3001:3001
            volumes:
            - "./server:/app"
            - /app/node_modules/

After that, go to the root directory that you chose for `docker-compose.yml` with command-prompt and use the commands `docker compose pull` to pull the images, `docker compose up` to create and run the containers. Finally use the `localhost:3000` to interact with the application.
